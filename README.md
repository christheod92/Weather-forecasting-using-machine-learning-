**Machine learning methods**

1.  Predicted variable: Daily maximum air temperature (maxtemp)
    - Machine learning model: Multiple linear regression, Random Forest
    - Evaluation Metrics: Root mean square error
    
2.  Predicted variable: Rainfall measured in millimeters (rainmm)  
    - Machine learning model: Multiple linear regression, Random Forest
    - Evaluation Metrics: Root mean square error
    
3.  Classification in autumn, winter, spring, summer
    - Machine learning model: Gaussian process, SVC
    - Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy
